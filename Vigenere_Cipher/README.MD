# Vigenere Cipher
* It is very similar to Caesar cryptosystem BUT we use several keys instead of just a single key.
* "Vigenere cryptosystem is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of intervowen Caesar Ciphers based on the letters of a keyword"
  1. It is a form of polyalphabetic substitution method.
  2. very easy to understand and to implement.
  3. it was constructed in the 16th century and it was thought to be unbreakable "the undecipherable cipher"
