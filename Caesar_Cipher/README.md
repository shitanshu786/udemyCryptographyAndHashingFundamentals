# Caesar Cipher
* Symmeteric Cryptography i.e. same key will be used for encrypting and decrypting
* Shift all characters by Key in search space.
* Easier to crack as finite search space.
* Cracking:
  * Brute Force
  * Frequency Analysis: 
    - We can analyse the cipher text and based on the most frequest letter in the cipher text we can predict the key (so the number of shifts).
    - E.g. In English language text some letters are more frequent than others *(E, A, O, I & T)*.
